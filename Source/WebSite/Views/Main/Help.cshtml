                        (1) assist in the documentation of compliance or (2) be of value in the creation of "candidate security patches".

                        Each BU has 35 days (typically from the vendor's patch release date) to "assess" the patch.  This assessment can be
                        performed by any SME in the BU which is associated with one of the Products linked to the patch.
                        If multiple SMEs within a BU have been associated with the Product, then all these SMEs have permission to represent the BU in the assessment
                        of the patch.  Only one assessment is allowed per patch per BU.
                    </div>

                    <div> The minimum required information that must be entered as part of the assessment is one of three “Assessment Results”:</div>

                        <li>Install the patch</li>
                        <li>Develop a mitigation plan (which can include patching some, but not all, devices)</li>
                        <li>Declaring that patch is NOT an applicable security patch for this BU</li>

                        If the assessment results in decision to develop a mitigation plan, a dialog box pops up so that the SME must enter a short description
                        (and/or attach documents) of the basis
                        for mitigation in lieu of patching.  As this dialog box closes, a new mitigation plan "place-keeper" is created in the MiPlan application.
                        An SME in the BU has 35 days to develop this plan and have it approved
                        by the BU Coordinator.
                    </div>
                    <div>If the assessment results in a decision to apply the patch(es), the SME is not required to enter a basis for this decision – but may do so.</div>
                    <div>
                        Importantly, finishing the assessment starts a new 35-day timer for this business unit for the action of (1) installing the patch
                        or (2) developing a mitigation plan.

                            Similarly, the corporation is not compliant if any individual BU
                            takes longer than 35 days to install the patch or development the mitigation plan.
                            Note since individual BUs can complete assessments on differing dates, the timer for compliance for patch installation or mitigation
                            plan development is on a BU-by-BU basis.
