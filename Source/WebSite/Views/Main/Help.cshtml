                        The <b>Target Platform</b> List.  This list exists to provide a convenient way for the PIC to assign a Business Unit (BU) a candidate security
                         patch for assessment.  As new patches are added to the system, they must be assigned to a Target Platform.

                    <li>
                        The <b>Business Unit Group</b> (BU Group) List.  Defines the BU Coordinator (BUC) that is accountable for one or more Platforms within openSPM. 
                        While there is typically just one BU Group per business unit, Owners can create as many groups as are needed to manage BUC / SME 
                        accountability relationships.

                <p>As new candidate security patches are discovered in Step 2, the PIC assigns the patch a corporate ID number and adds (copy and pastes)
                 the patch information from the vendor web site into openSPM.  The minimum required information for entry of a new patch is:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Corporate patch tacking number</li>
                    <li>Vendor / Source (from drop-down menu)</li>
                    <li>Vendor patch tracking ID</li>
                    <li>Patch title (80 characters max)</li>
                    <li>Vendor patch release date (this is used as the default start date for the 35-day period allowed for assessment)</li>
                    <li>Target Platform(s) (from drop-down menu) that directs the patch to one or more BUs for assessment.</li>

                    entry from for this additional information.  Documents, such as PDFs, can be attached if they available from the vendor.</p>

                by this patch – by clicking on the “start” button from the “Active Patches” menu selection.</p>
               <p>The PIC is asked to confirm the start date for compliance timers as part of this process.  The PIC will work with the Owner to assign
                 an appropriate start date if using the compliance default start of the “vendor release date” does not allow sufficient time for patch
                 assessment prior to expiration of the 35-day assessment period.  This compliance defect in “patch discovery” will be logged by openSPM,
                 but will not result in openSPM raising multiple compliance violation warnings and alarms to multiple business unit groups on “start”.</p>
